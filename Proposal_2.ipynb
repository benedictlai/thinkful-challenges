        "What is the problem you are attempting to solve?\n",
        "- I am attempting to solve customer trends with Telco Company. For example, I want to solve if a customer is going to churn based on the tenure of the customer, the preferences for contracts and if they are a senior citizen. I mention senior citizens because they are used to paying bills through the mail and they may not be benefitting from getting a discount to keep them from staying with the company.\n",
        "\n",
        "How is your solution valuable?\n",
        "- My solution is valuable because it will help determine if tenure customers are more likely to churn based on customer behavior such as the preferences for contracts, how long they have been a customer with Telco, and if they are a senior citizen. These factors may impact on customer retention. The results of my research will not only benefit Telco Company but it will also benefit other companies so it can inspire other customers to give true feedback to the company especially with the preferences of contracts.\n",
        "\n",
        "What is your data source and how will you access it?\n",
        "- The data source is from https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn. They are 7,044 customers in the dataset. I will not be using the whole data set because of some of the null values (TotalCharges) that may affect it.\n",
        "\n",
        "What techniques from the course do you anticipate using?\n",
        "- I anticipate using Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting & Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine, Feature Importances.\n",
        "\n",
        "What do you anticipate to be the biggest challenge you’ll face?\n",
        "- Getting the best accuracy rate on churn, cleaning messy data, handling the class imbalance are the biggest hurdles I'll face."
