A potential bias I see is that February is still in the winter season. Therefore, most people will
not visit a beach during that time. May isn't quite in the summer season. However, there is a 
better chance that people visit beaches during that timeframe. Also, most of the children will 
be home from school during summer break in May.

A potential bias I see is those anxious patients visiting a clinic are over the age of 50. If they
are the majority of them visiting the hospital and the general population has more people in their
mid to late 20s, then anxiety is prone to those type of demographic due to them getting older and having
health problems. Howver, there is a possibility that some of those people in that demographic will not
admit having anxiety and will not see a doctor.

A potential bias I see is that a revamped ad campaign will get more traction. However, that traction
may cool down if that campaign does not get rave reviews. Those views lose steam because customers
want to visit other new websites. This statement reminds me of when a season premiere show has a huge 
guest star to boost ratings, it loses steam the following week when the guest star does not return to the
episode.

A potential bias I see is the program has already failed. However, we cannot determine its fate 
based on one week because those customers during the second week may finally decide to join the program
when some of them were hestitant during the first week of the loyalty program.
