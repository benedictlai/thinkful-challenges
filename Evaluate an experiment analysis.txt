1. Emperor Palpatine has the most influence on his peers. The way to solve this is to advertise Emperor 
Palpatine's campaign slogans. Then, we need to check how many converts are involved.
2. Compared to other planets Jar Jar visited, when Windu visited those planets, they were 
not favorable like Jedi had hoped for.
3. It is not impossible that not all the workers from all countries participated in the survey.

4. The customers that purchase the app not only install them but also give permission to track their

5. The questions for each test will vary because of the different variations. It is not impossible
that the student with the best grades received the simple version while the average student received
the hardest version. The solution is that the student gets the same questions but in different numbers
and different letters in multiple choice questions. However, it may be a coincidence that the average
student would have made nearly the same grade on a different version of the test.
